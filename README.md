## Getting Started
<ul>
    <li>npm run webpack: run webpack only without node (which will be faster, but you cannot upload photo)</li>
    <li>npm run client: development for client only</li>
    <li>npm run server: development for server only</li>
    <li>npm run start: development for both client && server</li>
    <li>npm run build: production</li>
    <li>npm run default: run the current build</li>
</ul>
